Cleaning up the sloppiness/getting redisciplined
Being a more fun/entertaining/upbeat/smiling guy

That's it, isn't it?

A true epiphany right now, an aha moment.

It's been enough for me to 'show up' so far in my life.  
But I get the feeling that life is asking more of me now.
I have to step it up, take it to the next level.
No more riding the wave, time to refashion myself and my lifestyle.
How?
More discipline, more involvement, more happiness, more sharing.
Entering into some rougher waters, stepping up to some challenges.
Approaching those challenges with the best attitude that I can.
Feeling really good about where I am and where I am going.

I've just been showing up.  Now it's time to excel up.
The foundation has been built, and then the first floor was.
Now it's time for the second/third floor.
Enough with the coasting, it's time for more engagement.

I'm ready.  Now what?

Attracting - people, conditions, opportunities.
I feel different now as compared to last week.
Dive in.
Go for it.

Time is short, accomplishments are few.

Vague idea of being a Detroit player.  How?

I showed up to meet Devon on Saturday night.  Not enough.
I could have seduced her, but I'm not at that level.
It's time to move beyond showing up.

I show up at work, but I go through the motions.  Not enough.
Learned helpnessess is not acceptable.
It's time to move beyond showing up.

I show up to meet friends at different events.  Not enough.
What am I giving back?
It's time to move beyond showing up.

Showing up is not good enough anymore, I can do that. It's time for stepping up.
Being fully engaged with myself and with life.
Not going through the motions, but moving decisively, and with purpose.
A purposeful life.  
Enliven.  En - to put in, make & liven - life  To put in life
Doing what I what I can do, as soon as I can do it.
Don't delay - execute.
Expand. Enliven.
