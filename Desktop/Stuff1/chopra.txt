Attention is focused awareness. There are some basic requirements to be met. The first is being centered, the skill we covered to begin this series 
of posts. Distraction is self-defeating. Second, your awareness focuses naturally when you have a desire. We focus on what we want. Third, 
attention works best when combined with intention – envisioning a way to fulfill your desire. When the three ingredients come together – 
you are centered, you have a desire, you intend to fulfill your desire – attention becomes extremely powerful.
