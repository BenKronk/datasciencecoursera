What can I do to make this job better?


The internal fire has to burn!!!


I need to make fewer mistakes
Do it now!
Take lots of notes!

How can I get better?  
**By being myself, by acting authentically, connectedness with my amness, guided by my intuition, paying attention to my center.
**Be in the flow of my life - I sense it, and I need to not fight it, but roll with it.
**Do what I do now as well as I can, until a new opportunity comes along.

I want to be wealthy, but I don't want to do sales.
I'd love to start a new business, but I don't have any good ideas.
I'd love to advance my career, but nothing is going to happen here.
I'd love to buy a business, but I don't have any particular expertise.
I don't want to be conventional, but I am kind of being conventional.

I've been on a rapid upward trajectory since 2010, but I have likely already grabbed the proverbial low hanging fruit. 
It gets harder from here - probably much harder to continue to advance, to move forward.

How to advance? 
FOCUS on my tasks, whatever they may be 
Be present and centered
Know thyself so I can be myself
Do my best
Try different things
Stay active
Do it now!
Connect with the right people

I want to do something, but I don't know what to do:
*Career-wise
*Socially
*Relationship-wise

Where do I want to end up?  That's the key question.
-> I say that I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense, if I really know myself.
