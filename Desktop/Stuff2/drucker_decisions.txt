Flood of emotion - how to deal?  Just recognize it, relax, and let it flow through me until its gone.

I can't get the answers from someone else on how to live my life; they're going to have to come from 
within, from making mistakes and learning how to do better, from straight grinding it out, from
feedback analysis.

Major decisions that I have made:

MBA - good, opened up career opportunities
Leave MyBuys
Join ACSI
Stop taking Wellbutrin - bad
Get back into the gym
Not continue with Christina - trusted myself, good
Attend Washington Campus - good, needed to be done with school, was burning out
Finish school in April - good, was burning out
Repaired with parents - good, didn't want to, but had to be done
RSB Club - good

Future decisions:

Stay in Detroit?
Buy house?
Who to date?
Have children?

Made it about as far financially as I could have given all the depression.

What about the incremental decisions that I make?
*Lying on the couch
*Not brushing/flossing
*Having only a semi-clean home
*Having a semi-clean car
*Not being present

what is most important to me is manifested in my decisions - big and small.

I may not know the WHAT to do, but I do know the HOW - i.e. I can choose the manner in which address and
resolve situations/issues/tasks, even though those things may be mundane, uninspiring, etc.; this is 
whatI need to take pleasure from - doing things well, with QUALITY.

When I have a decision to make, I need to ask myself -
NOT: 'What is most enjoyable/pleasurable?' 
BUT: 'What will benefit me the most?'

QUALITY
PREPARATION
WINNING
ACTION
CONFIDENCE

I need to continue to test myself emotionally, mentally, socially, spiritually, professionally.  How do 
I do so regularly?
