Who am I?

I don't know!

How will I come to know myself?

By being present - allowing my true self to come into being by emanating from within me.

This is an extraordinary epiphany, because now I am not shackled to the past or chained to some nonexistent
version of the future me and my life.  I am truly free, and I feel free!

I have given up trying to 'figure it out'!  I will let myself be guided...

What do I want out of life?

Security
challenge and Growth
Quality Relationships
Freedom to live as I choose
Engagement
Health
Contribution
Action
Fun
Happiness
