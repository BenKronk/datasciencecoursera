Follow up: Senior Analyst vs. Analyst

Hi Eric,

I'm checking in again regarding available career opportunities on your team.  Upon further reflection, I feel may not be the best fit for the Senior 
Analyst role, but I would welcome the opportunity to be considered for an Analyst role - would you have any thoughts on this?  As you continue to seek out 
the best fit for your team, I hope to remain part of the process.  Are there any further questions regarding my skills and experience that I can address
for you?

The more that I have learned about iKnowtion and the work that you do, the more excited I have become about the opportunity.  Would it be possible for 
me to demonstrate the required skills to you?  This could be a good way to determine fit once and for all.

Please let me know what I can do to further my application.

Thank you,

Ben
