always active.  Livesperience?

If I do my best each day, that's all that I can do.  I may die tomorrow, but the only way to feel okay about that (not that it would be okay) is that

The 'meaning of life' is defined as the meaning that one gives to it when one is fully connected with one's authentic self.  What is authentically
important to one at any one moment in time.  Which means that the meaning is malleable, but is likely driven by strong underlying currents.  The 
importance that one gives to things define one's life.  The decisions that one makes (conscious or unconscious) determine what is important to a
person.

Connected decisions > Authentic importance > Meaning of life
