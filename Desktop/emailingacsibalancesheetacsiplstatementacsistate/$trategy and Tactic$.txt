Goal: Make a lot of money

Okay, what are some ways to make money?

Existing job
Freelance consulting
Second job
Win the lottery
Gambling, i.e. playing poker
Get a raise
Find some money
Start a side business
Get a new higher paying job

Sales is a way to make money, but I don't like it very much, so it's not sustainable.


Alright, how about some ways to save money?

Auto insurance will go down - couple months
Eat out less - current
Go to a cheaper gym - later this year
Get a cheaper car - next year
Drive less/work from home - ask boss
Drink less - current

Things that I like to do, but may have to hold off on:
Play golf
Visit NYC
Bedspread
Tiger games
Spending money on women


I'm going to live my life, and cut where I can.  I may go into some debt, but I make that decision consciously.
